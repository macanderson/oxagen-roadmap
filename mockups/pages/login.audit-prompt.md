# Audit prompt — Log in

Copy everything below the line into a fresh agent session. Fill the two placeholders. The agent
audits the built page against this design and reports a verdict per check; it does not fix anything
unless told to in a second turn.

---

You are auditing the **Log in** page of Oxagen Mission Control (`#/welcome/login`) for conformance to its design. Be exact and adversarial: the design is the spec, and “close enough” is a fail. Do not summarise what you see; compare it.

## Inputs

1. The page spec: `pages/login.md` (read it first, in full).
2. The design, rendered: the `login` stories in Storybook (`npm run storybook`), one per state (loaded, loading, error, access denied), desktop and mobile; or `mockups/missioncontrol.html?product=1&state=<state>&mobile=<0|1>#<route>` in a browser or with Playwright.
3. The product spec for context: `docs/mission-control-spec.md` §14 (Mission Control), Appendix F (the pages that survive), Appendix A (target tables); the data mapping in `docs/implementation-plan.md` §3.
4. The build under audit: `{{APP_ROOT}}` (the Next.js app), served at `{{APP_URL}}`. Route under audit: `/welcome/login`.

## Procedure

Work through every check. For each, record PASS, FAIL, or N/A (with why). Cite evidence: a file and line in the build, a screenshot path, or a DOM selector and its text.

1. **Route and shell.** The build serves the route; there is no app shell — brandmark and a centred card only. The document title names the page.
2. **Header.** Eyebrow “Welcome back”, h1 “Log in to Mission Control”. Actions present, in order, with the same labels: Log in. Exactly one gold (primary) action on the screen.
3. **Summary tiles.** None on this page; fail if the build added decorative ones.
4. **Sections, tabs and tables.** For each item below, the build has it, with the same tab labels (and live counts where the design shows them), the same panel headings, and every table column named in the spec, in that order. Missing or renamed columns are FAILs; extra columns are noted.
   - Sign in with: Google · GitHub — then “or”. Form: Work email · Password (show/hide; Forgot password? link) · “Keep me logged in on this device for 30 days” checkbox.
   - Footer: “New to Oxagen? Create an account · Have an invitation? Accept it”.
5. **Actions and dialogs.** Every button in the spec exists, opens what the spec says (no dialogs), and each write is a governed action: it passes IAM, produces an audit event, and shows a receipt or reference. A stub must say what the product would do; a control that silently does nothing is a FAIL.
6. **Data sources.** For each row of the spec’s data-source table, find the adapter or query in the build that feeds it. ✅ rows must be wired to the named store; 🟡 rows must be wired for the fields that exist and render `NotBacked` (an honest “not recorded yet”, never a zero) for the rest; ❌ rows must render `NotBacked` with the milestone named. A fixture reaching production is a FAIL.
7. **States.** Force each state and compare copy and controls with the design file:
   - **loading** (`state=loading`): the shell stays and the body is the skeleton; no data, no zeros, no stale rows.
   - **error** (`state=error`): “Email or password is wrong. Check both and try again, or reset your password.” Email field marked bad.
   - **access denied** (`state=denied`): Full-card state: “This account is suspended” — who suspended it (the organization owner), when, that recorded runs are kept and no new run tokens are minted. Action: Contact your organization owner.
   Loading must not flash zeros. Error must name the code and offer Try again and Open an incident. Denied must name the missing permission and offer Request access.
8. **Trust language.** Every tier, replay grade, attestation and cost basis on the page shows the recorded value; search the build for any place a stronger word could be rendered than the record allows (every agent and run is `observe` or `harness`; `gateway` and `contained` render only as not yet available; nothing says enforced about the harness tier). Money always carries its basis.
9. **Mobile.** At 390 × 844 with a touch pointer: the card fills the width with 16 px gutters, buttons are full width and ≥ 44 px, inputs are 16 px, code inputs use the numeric keypad. Compare against `pages/login-loaded-mobile.html`.
10. **Accessibility.** Tabs use `role=tablist/tab` with `aria-selected`; dialogs are `role=dialog aria-modal` with a labelled close; icon buttons have `aria-label`; state is never colour alone (dot + word); focus is visible; the page is operable by keyboard end to end.
11. **Permissions.** Read requires `public`; each write (auth.login) is gated server-side, not only hidden in the UI. Verify with a role that lacks the permission.
12. **Nothing extra.** List anything on the built page that is not in the spec (tiles, tabs, columns, buttons, copy). Each is a finding; the reviewer decides whether it stays.

## Output

Return a single markdown report:

```
# Log in — audit {{DATE}}
Verdict: PASS | FAIL (n fails, m notes)

| # | Check | Result | Evidence | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Route and shell | PASS | … | |
| … | | | | |

## Fails, most severe first
1. <what is wrong> — <where> — <what the design shows> — <the smallest change that fixes it>

## Not in the spec
- …

## Data sources not backed (expected NotBacked, and whether the build renders it honestly)
- …
```

Rules: never mark PASS on an assumption — open the file or the DOM. Quote the design’s copy verbatim when a label differs. If the build cannot be started or the route is missing, stop and report that as the single FAIL.

# Oxagen Mission Control: build plan

> **Historical planning snapshot (September 2026):** The measurements and delivery instructions below predate the completed app rebuild. Use [the current app architecture](https://github.com/macanderson/oxagen/blob/main/apps/app/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Mission Control spec](../specs/mission-control/spec.md) when implementing changes.

> The product name Mission Control was retired on 2026-09-19 by [ADR-113](https://github.com/macanderson/oxagen/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-113-workforce-management-leads-mission-control-is-retired.md); this folder keeps its name as a path, and this plan keeps its text.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-09-12 |
| **Owner** | Mac Anderson |
| **Source** | `docs/specs/mission-control/spec.md` (§14 Mission Control, §16 carry over / leave behind, §17 delivery plan, Appendix A/E/F); the implementation plan is `docs/specs/mission-control/plan.md` |
| **Reference implementation** | `mc.html` in https://github.com/macanderson/tmp-oxagen-mockups |

This plan does not restate the spec. It records the decisions the spec left open, the
measurements that back them, and the order the work happens in.

---

## 1. The finding that shapes everything

The spec is not 90% written and 10% missing. It is ~97% decided, and the remaining work is
**extraction**, not design. Three artifacts already agree:

| Artifact | Measured | Agreement |
|---|---|---|
| Spec Appendix F | 70 routes collapse to 10 pages | `apps/app` has exactly **70** `page.tsx` files |
| Spec Appendix E | 229 contracts collapse to 96 tools | `packages/oxagen/src/contracts/` declares **228** |
| `mc.html` `route()` | emits 10 pages | the **same 10**, at the **same route shapes** |

Appendix E says every target tool needs "an input schema, an output schema, a risk grade, and
a default effect." Measured against the live tree:

- **205 of 228** live contracts already declare both a Zod `input` and `output`.
- **207** declare `agent.riskLevel`; **228** declare `defaultEffect`.
- **74 of the 96** target tools have every absorbed contract resolving to a live file.

So 77% of the "missing" schema layer is already written, tested, and in production. It needs
to be *carried*, not authored. See `TOOL-MATRIX.md` for the row-by-row mapping.

## 2. Decisions

### 2.1 The frontend is kept and emptied. It is not rebuilt.

Measured in `apps/app` by **import reachability** from the surviving route set, not by
directory name. `docs/oxagen/mission-control/scripts/reachability.mjs` walks the import graph from
the ten surviving pages plus the sign-in/callback routes and every Next.js entry convention
(`layout`, `middleware`, `route`, `error`, `manifest`), and asks which files nothing surviving
can reach.

| Set | Files | LOC | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reachable from a surviving route | 318 | 43,685 | **keep** |
| Reachable **only** from a dying route | 318 | 61,539 | delete: proven unreachable |
| Tests belonging to those dying files | 197 | 43,036 | delete with their subjects |
| **Total deletion** | **515** | **104,575** | 53% of `apps/app/src` |
| `packages/ui` | none | 9,860 | **keep** |

An earlier estimate in this document put the deletion at ~85,000 LOC of components based on
directory names. Reachability is the better instrument and disagrees with it in both
directions: it clears files in feature-named directories that a surviving page still imports,
and it condemns files in innocuous-looking ones. The manifest is
`docs/mission-control/delete-manifest.json`.

Reachability also found 28 files that nothing imports at all. All 28 are legitimate framework
entry points (`app/manifest.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, server actions, `*.d.ts`, vitest setup), not
dead code. An import walk cannot see a framework convention, so it reports them as orphans.
The other 422 "orphans" are test files, which nothing imports by construction.

The stack (`next@16.3.1`, `react@19.2.6`, `@base-ui/react`, Tailwind, `better-auth`,
`lucide-react`, `motion`) is current and is what a greenfield choice would land on.

The deciding detail is the design system, not the framework: `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
already implements the house brand the mockups are drawn in (Space Grotesk at 600, `--ink`
tokens, and an explicit "Space Grotesk is not a code face" rule). A rewrite would discard the
one layer that is already correct.

**Decision: keep the app shell and the kit. Delete ~85% of what is inside. Rebuild the ten
pages against the mockup.**

### 2.2 Map before delete

Deletion is the right first move, because every later step's cost scales with what is still
in the tree. It still runs second, not first.

The asset inside the 47 unabsorbed contracts and the ~85k LOC of components is not the code.
It is the **encoded decisions**: Zod schemas, validation messages, edge cases that were hit in
production. Appendix E's `Absorbs` column is a file-level migration map; deleting before
extracting means re-deriving from DDL what already exists in TypeScript and passes tests.

**Order: map (§3) → harvest → delete → rebuild.**

### 2.3 "Absorbed" and "folded into" are different, and the split is not mechanical

The generated deletion manifest classifies a contract as a deletion candidate when no target
tool names it in `Absorbs`. That is a binary test, and the spec is not binary: Appendix E says
of `list_roles` that it is "folded into `get_agent` and the Tools page." A folded read side is
not a deletion: its schema still has to land somewhere.

Contracts flagged as candidates that are probably folds, not deletes, and need a human call:
`list_iam_roles`, `get_org_settings`, `get_workspace_settings`, `get_prompt_settings`, and the
four `repo/*` reads (`get_pr`, `get_pr_diff`, `list_branches`, `get_ci_status`), because the spec
keeps the GitHub App and the code graph.

**The deletion manifest is a proposal that gets reviewed, never executed blind.**

## 3. Phases

| Phase | Delivers | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 Map** | `TOOL-MATRIX.md`, the route classification, the deletion manifest, all regenerable from the spec | The matrix regenerates from a clean checkout and the counts match this document |
| **P1 Harvest** | Every `INHERIT` tool's carried schema extracted to `packages/oxagen/src/contracts/v2/`, with the absorbed sources cited per file | 74 tools have an input schema, an output schema, a risk grade, and a default effect, each traceable to the contract it came from |
| **P2 Delete** | The reviewed deletion manifest applied: unabsorbed contracts, absorbed routes, page-bound components, and the leave-behind packages | `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` pass. No route 404s that Appendix F says should redirect |
| **P3 Fixtures** | `mc.html`'s `DB`/`AGENTS`/`ORG` extracted to typed fixtures shared by the UI and the handler tests | A screen and its handler assert against the same fixture |
| **P4 Design** | The 22 `NEW` tools' schemas, written against Appendix A's DDL and the mockup's rendered fields | Each has a schema, a risk grade, a default effect, and a test |
| **P5 Run slice** | `/{org}/{ws}/runs/{run}` end to end: frame player, transport, cost strip, chain status | The §17 M1 acceptance test: a run can be halted mid-loop from the UI, and an exported run verifies offline |

P5 is deliberately the hardest screen. It exercises the frame envelope, the ledger invariants,
and the recorder in one pass. Fleet is easier and teaches nothing that de-risks the rest.

## 4. What the 22 new tools actually are

They are not scattered. They cluster into the governance model that has no equivalent today:

| Cluster | Tools | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| Mandates | `grant_mandate`, `revoke_mandate`, `list_mandates` | M2 |
| Policy | `set_policy`, `simulate_policy` | M2 |
| Kill switches and approval rules | `set_kill_switch`, `set_approval_rules`, `approve_tool_schema`, `list_approvals` | M2 |
| Agent messaging | `send_message`, `list_messages` | Series A (§7.6) |
| Spend truth | `get_reconciliation`, `export_statement`, `set_funding_source` | M2/M5 |
| Audit surface | `set_legal_hold`, `list_incidents`, `set_event_subscription`, `list_event_subscriptions` | M5 |
| Other | `set_role_grants`, `export_run`, `load_tools`, `get_record` | M1–M3 |

Fourteen of the twenty-two are M2 Control. **M2 is the real build; M0/M1 are largely a carry.**

## 5. Regenerating the map

```sh
node docs/oxagen/mission-control/scripts/extract-contracts.mjs packages/oxagen/src/contracts contracts.json
node docs/oxagen/mission-control/scripts/build-matrix.mjs <spec.md> contracts.json matrix.json
node docs/oxagen/mission-control/scripts/build-routes.mjs <spec.md> apps/app routes.json
node docs/oxagen/mission-control/scripts/emit-matrix-md.mjs matrix.json matrix-orphans.json docs/mission-control/TOOL-MATRIX.md
```

The matrix is generated, never hand-edited. If a count in this document disagrees with a fresh
run, the document is wrong.

# Oxagen Workspace Config — a structured, governed CLAUDE.md replacement

**Status:** design · **Owner:** Mac Anderson · **Surface:** CLI + web + agent engine

## 1. Goal

Replace prose `CLAUDE.md` with a **structured, machine-reliable, multi-scope, governed**
configuration that the CLI agent, the web agent, and humans all read and write. Instead of
the agent grepping `package.json` for the test command or inferring conventions from prose, it
reads *reliable points of reference*: the exact commands, the branch/commit/PR conventions, the
per-language rules, the project's vision, the tooling it has available. The same config powers
the web app because it is keyed to the Oxagen workspace identity.

Non-goals: replacing `settings.json` (machine/tool settings — model, permissions, hooks — stay
separate); replacing the code graph (this is a *config + tooling* index, complementary to the
*code* index).

## 2. Files & scopes

The filename **is** the scope, and each maps to an entity the web app already understands.

| Scope | File | Written by | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ORG** | `~/.oxagen/managed.json` | org only (provisioned onto the machine, MDM-style) | highest — every entry implicitly `locked`, dev cannot override |
| **USER** | `~/.oxagen/user.json` | dev (local) + web (profile) | personal global |
| **WORKSPACE** | `<ws>/.oxagen/workspace.json` | dev (local) + web (workspace) | project config **+ the existing web-workspace identity** |
| **REPO** | `<repo>/.oxagen/repo.json` | dev (local) | per-repo, only when a workspace spans multiple repos (collapses into workspace when 1:1) |

`workspace.json` already exists today as the tenant **link** (`WorkspaceLink`:
`orgSlug/orgId/workspaceSlug/workspaceId/repos/linkedAt`). We **extend** it — identity stays,
config sections are added — so one file = one web workspace, identity + config together.
`managed.json` is read-only to the CLI.

## 3. Resolution semantics

Reuses the merge engine already in `apps/cli/src/settings/resolve.ts` (scalars: higher wins;
lists: concat + dedupe), extended to 4 scopes with governance:

- **Preferences / scalars** (commands, packageManagers, branch prefix, attribution): **most-specific
  wins** — `REPO > WORKSPACE > USER > ORG` — for developer ergonomics.
- **Lists** (language items, sources): **accumulate** — union by `id` across all scopes.
- **Governance**: any entry can be `locked: true`; everything in `managed.json` is implicitly
  locked. A locked entry cannot be overridden or removed by a lower scope; **locked conflicts
  resolve `ORG > USER > WORKSPACE > REPO`** (the stated precedence, enforced).
- `oxagen config explain <path>` reports the winning scope and *"locked by managed.json (org)."*

## 4. Schema (`workspace.json`, all sections)

```

**Item shape** (a language `item` or a derived convention):
`{ id, kind: rule|preference|policy|convention|reference, text?|doc?, enforced?, locked?, scope?, origin: manual|scan|research, source?, confidence? }`.
`origin`/`source` give provenance so `explain` can say *"from researching the Rust API guidelines."*

## 5. Consolidation / indexing (`oxagen config build`)

Scans the `sources` at both scopes and builds the read-only `consolidated` index: every
**skill, custom agent definition, MCP server (+ the tools it exposes), command, custom tool**,
and the `CLAUDE.md`/`.cursorrules`/`AGENTS.md` conventions — across Claude Code, Cursor, and
Oxagen. Deduped with precedence (workspace beats user on name clash; both recorded), each entry
scope- and source-attributed. Idempotent; human-authored sections untouched. Built on demand +
cached like the code graph; refreshed on change. This is a **tooling index** that complements
the code graph — the agent knows its full capability surface without re-scanning.

## 6. `/settings` — an interview, not a form

`/settings` (REPL) and `oxagen settings` (CLI) launch a **config-builder agent** running the
engine loop with a specialized prompt and a purpose-built toolset:

- **scan tools** — read `CLAUDE.md`/`.cursorrules`/`.cursor`/`.agents`/skills/MCP/`package.json` → propose derived config.
- **web tools** — `websearch` + `webfetch`, so it derives conventions from *online* sources, not just local files. e.g. *"research Rust best practices and pick what fits a CLI tool"* → websearch → webfetch top authoritative sources → assess fit against what the repo already does → propose a curated, **cited** set → user approves → written to the chosen scope.
- **config-write tools** — `setVision`, `addCommand`, `addLanguageItem`, `setVoice`, `setWorktreeSeed`, etc., scoped to `--workspace` or `--user`. Reads `managed.json` to show what is locked; never writes it.

The flow interviews the user (vision, commands, languages, voice, worktree seeds), proposing
derived defaults from the scan + web research and confirming each. First-run does a full pass;
later runs are targeted edits.

## 7. CLI surface

`oxagen settings` / `/settings` (interview) · `oxagen config init | build | get <path> | set <path> <val> --scope … | add <lang> <kind> "…" | remove <id> | explain <path> | lint | pull`. REPL slash: `/settings`, `/config`, `/rule`, `/vision`.

## 8. Web / org

ORG + USER scopes are edited in the web app and delivered locally: `user.json` syncs
bidirectionally (`oxagen config pull`, like `env:pull`); `managed.json` is org-provisioned and
locked. Because `workspace.json` carries `workspaceId`, the web app reads/writes the same
logical record.

## 9. Agent consumption

The resolved config becomes a **structured `projectContext`**: `vision` → an anchor block;
`enforced` rules → the hard-rules section; `commands` → the agent runs the *right* dev/test
script instead of guessing; `vcs` → correct branch names, commit attribution, PR footers;
`worktrees.seed` → best-of-N and the fleet bring up working worktrees; `consolidated` → the
agent knows its skills/agents/MCP-tools/commands. Pairs with the graph-first mandate: reliable
*code* references (code graph) + reliable *config* references (this).

## 10. Build phasing

1. Spec (this doc).
2. Schema + types — zod for all sections; `WorkspaceLink` → `WorkspaceConfig` (back-compatible).
3. Resolver — extend `settings/resolve.ts` to 4 scopes + `locked`/managed authority + list-accumulate; `explain`.
4. `oxagen config` commands + feed resolved config into `projectContext`.
5. Indexer — `oxagen config build` multi-scope consolidation.
6. `/settings` interview agent — scan + `websearch`/`webfetch` (wire web tools if absent) + scoped write tools.
7. Web app surface for org (`managed.json`) + user scopes.

## 11. Open questions

- `websearch`/`webfetch` tools: confirm whether they exist in the CLI toolset or need adding (blocks phase 6).
- Are natural-language/voice prefs org-lockable (brand consistency)? Default: **yes, lockable**.
- Does `repo.json` earn its place now, or defer until a multi-repo workspace exists? Default: **schema-reserve it, implement later.**

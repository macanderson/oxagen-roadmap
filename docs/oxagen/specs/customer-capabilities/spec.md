# Customer-Built Capability Packages (`.cap`)

> **2026-09-07 note:** [ADR-043](https://github.com/macanderson/oxagen/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-043-runtime-excision.md) deleted
> `generate_svg`/`generate_image`/`generate_video`, `agent.sandbox.start`,
> `agent.compose`, and `skill.version.activate` — the worked examples this
> spec uses throughout to illustrate the generic capability-mounting
> mechanism (REST route table, app runner page, storage adapter seam, chain
> tagging). The generic `.cap` mechanism the spec proposes is orthogonal to
> ADR-043 and not itself deleted; re-ground each worked example in a
> capability that still exists (e.g. `ontology.query` or any other surviving
> `agent`-surface capability) before implementing against it.

**Status:** Proposed (spec for review)
**Date:** 2026-07-18
**ADR:** `docs/adr/ADR-034-customer-capability-packages.md`
**Plan:** `docs/specs/customer-capabilities/plan.md`
**Supersedes:** ADR-013 Phase 3 (`plugin.capability_catalog` + out-of-process partner handler protocol — never built)
**Builds on:** ADR-009, ADR-013 Phases 1–2, ADR-025, ADR-007/ADR-011, ADR-002, `docs/specs/workspace-scoped-marketplace/SPEC.md`, `docs/specs/sandbox-templates-portable/`

## 1. Scope

Let customers **design, build, package, version, install, and ship their own
capabilities** with the same strictness as first-party ones — typed contract,
handler, full surface parity — while Oxagen does all of the surfacing:

- Authored **as code, in the customer's own Git repository** (not database
  configuration). Versioned by their SCM; releases are tags.
- Packaged as a **`.cap` file** — a zip archive with a required structure and
  manifest — that is portable, installable, and immutable per version.
- Installed **per workspace**, gated by the existing kernel entitlement seam,
  IAM role grants, billing, and audit.
- Surfaced automatically — REST endpoint, MCP tool, agent tool, app UI, CLI
  command — **from configuration, with zero surface code written by the
  customer**. The customer decides *where* it surfaces (manifest flags);
  Oxagen's generic binders do *how*.

**The running example** used throughout: Acme Corp wants AI agents (running on
a non-Oxagen agent platform) to automate **returns & refunds processing**. Acme
writes one contract + one handler, declares
`surfaces: ["api", "mcp", "agent", "app", "cli"]`, and gets: a REST endpoint
their systems call, an MCP tool any external agent runner can invoke against
their workspace MCP endpoint, an in-app form + result card, and a CLI command —
without writing a route, a tool file, a React page, or a commander block.

### Non-goals (v1)

- A public marketplace with community publishing and revenue share
  (`workspace-scoped-marketplace` and `skills-marketplace` cover the listing
  substrate; publishing customer packages *between* orgs is Phase 4+).
- Non-JavaScript handler runtimes (the runner image is Node 20+; WASM and
  container-per-package runtimes are a later runner profile).
- Custom UI components authored by publishers — stubbed in §10.4 and deferred
  to a dedicated spec; v1 ships the auto-form runner page + curated
  components only.
- Replacing connectors/MCP-server plugins or skills. Those remain their own
  plugin types; a `.cap` is specifically **executable capability code**.
- Mobile surface bindings (ADR-026 parity applies once the app binder exists).

---

## 2. Why: the current cost of a capability

The platform's dispatch core is already dynamic and config-driven:

- **One contract** carries everything: name, domain, description, mode,
  surfaces, IAM defaults, sensitivity, agent metadata, render hints, chaining
  tags, Zod input/output (`CapabilityDeclaration`,
  `packages/oxagen/src/types.ts:145`).
- **One dispatch chokepoint**: `invoke(name, input, ctx, { surface })`
  (`packages/oxagen/src/kernel.ts:504`) — surface allowlist → input parse →
  IAM (fail-closed) → billing admission → entitlement gate → handler →
  output parse → security/trace events.
- **One proof that generic binding works**: the agent surface has **zero
  per-capability files** — `materializeTools`
  (`packages/agent/src/runtime/materialize-tools.ts:338`) iterates
  `listCapabilities()`, filters by surface/entitlement, and builds every tool
  from `cap.name`/`cap.description`/`cap.input`.

Everything *around* that core is hand-written per capability:

| Surface | Per-capability artifact today | Count |
|---|---|---|
| REST | `apps/api/src/routes/v1/<name>.ts` (parse → `invoke()`) **plus** an import line and a `.route()` line hand-listed in `apps/api/src/app.ts` | 276 route files, 571 `.route()` calls |
| MCP | `apps/mcp/src/tools/<name>.ts` — schema/name/description all re-exported *from the contract*, plus per-field `.describe()` overlays | 330 files |
| App | Optional server action + `capability-ui-map.json` entry + form component (`generate_video` has one; svg/image ride the chat render registry) | per-`app`-layer capability |
| CLI | Hand-wired commander blocks per domain (`apps/cli/src/commands/*.ts`), calling REST | per domain |
| Agent | — (registry-driven) | 0 |

Adding one capability costs **~7–10 files**, of which the REST wrapper, the
`app.ts` lines, and the MCP tool file are purely mechanical projections of the
contract. Parity is maintained by after-the-fact gates
(`check:manifest`, `check:ui-parity`, `route-contract-parity.test.ts`,
`tool-registry.test.ts`) — they catch regressions, but they verify hand-work
instead of eliminating it.

**Customers cannot add a capability at all.**
Contracts register at compile time via import side effects
(`packages/oxagen/src/registry.ts:48`); handlers bind in
`packages/handlers/src/register.ts`; there is no dynamic path. ADR-013 shipped
the install/entitlement half (manifest, `installed_plugins`, kernel gate,
`capability_not_installed`) and explicitly deferred the other half — a DB
catalog and out-of-process execution — which was never built.

This spec closes that gap, and pays down the first-party boilerplate on the
way (the binders that make customer capabilities possible are the same ones
that delete our own wrapper files).

```

Five pillars, each specified below:

1. **The `.cap` package format** (§5) — what a package is.
2. **Authoring experience** (§6) and **contracts across the trust boundary**
   (§7) — how customers write one.
3. **Dynamic registry overlay** (§8) — how the kernel learns about installs.
4. **The capability runner** (§9) — where customer code executes and what it
   is allowed to touch.
5. **The surface parity engine** (§10) — how every surface materializes
   bindings from configuration; **install & lifecycle** (§11) and
   **security** (§12) wrap around all of it.

Design invariant: **the kernel remains the single dispatch and
enforcement path.** This design adds a second *source of capability
declarations* and a second *place handlers execute* — never a second way to
call one.

---

## 4. Naming

Runtime-canonical names of installed capabilities are

```
{namespace}_{action}
e.g.  acme_returns_process_refund
      namespace = acme_returns   action = process_refund
```

- `action` must independently satisfy ADR-025: `verb_noun[_qualifier]`,
  verb from the closed action vocabulary (`tools/scripts/check-naming.mjs`),
  snake_case.
- `namespace` is registered once per org (globally unique, see §8.1) and is
  rejected if its first token is in the ADR-025 action vocabulary. Since every
  platform capability name **starts** with an action verb and every installed
  name **starts** with a namespace that *cannot* be an action verb, static and
  installed names cannot collide.
- The full name is what flows everywhere a capability name flows today:
  `role_grants.capability_id` (a text column, not an FK —
  `packages/database/src/schema/iam.ts:118` — so **no migration is needed**
  for grants), ClickHouse `tool_invocations.capability_name`, audit rows,
  MCP tool names, model-facing tool names (via the existing
  `toModelToolName` aliasing).
- Display names are free-form (`displayName: "Process refund"`); docs and UI
  show display names with the canonical name as the stable identifier,
  mirroring how `docs/capabilities/` shows dotted legacy labels beside
  ADR-025 names during the naming migration.

The shared validator moves to `packages/oxagen/src/naming.ts` so
`check-naming.mjs` (in-repo contracts) and the package validation pipeline
(installed contracts) enforce identical rules.

---

## 5. The `.cap` package format

A `.cap` file is a **zip archive** (deterministic ordering, no compression
tricks) with this required layout:

```
acme-returns-1.2.0.cap
├── manifest.json                     # REQUIRED — machine artifact, generated by `cap build`
├── contracts/
│   ├── process_refund.input.json     # REQUIRED per capability — JSON Schema (portable subset)
│   ├── process_refund.output.json    # REQUIRED per capability
│   └── lookup_return_status.{input,output}.json
├── handlers/
│   └── bundle.mjs                    # REQUIRED — single bundled ESM module, all handlers
├── ui/                               # RESERVED — custom components are NOT processed in v1
│   └── …                             # (validation warns and ignores; §10.4 stub)
├── docs/
│   ├── process_refund.md             # REQUIRED per capability — the `docs` layer, rendered in-app
│   └── lookup_return_status.md
├── assets/                           # OPTIONAL — icons, screenshots (icon.svg reserved)
├── CHANGELOG.md                      # REQUIRED — human changelog
└── integrity.json                    # REQUIRED — sha256 per file + package digest (§12.5)
```

### 5.1 The manifest

`manifest.json` is **generated, never hand-edited** — the authored source of
truth is TypeScript (§6). It extends the shipped plugin manifest
(`oxagenPluginManifestSchema`, `packages/oxagen/src/plugins/manifest.ts:32`)
and follows the `kind` + literal-version convention of the portable
sandbox-template manifest v1
(`packages/oxagen/src/contracts/sandbox-template-manifest.ts:151`):

```jsonc
{
  "kind": "oxagen.capability-package",
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "id": "acme/returns",                       // publisher-scoped package id
  "namespace": "acme_returns",                // §4 — org-registered, unique
  "version": "1.2.0",                         // semver, immutable once published
  "displayName": "Acme Returns & Refunds",
  "description": "Automates refunds and returns processing against Acme's OMS.",
  "publisher": { "org": "acme", "contact": "platform@acme.com" },
  "runtime": { "kind": "node", "range": ">=20" },
  "sdk": { "capSdk": "^1.0.0" },              // host API contract version (§9.3)

  "capabilities": [
    {
      "action": "process_refund",             // runtime name: acme_returns_process_refund
      "displayName": "Process refund",
      "description": "Validate a return, compute the refund, execute it in the OMS, and notify the customer.",
      "mode": "sync",                         // "sync" | "async"  (§9.5)
      "surfaces": ["api", "mcp", "agent", "app", "cli"],
      "contract": {
        "input": "contracts/process_refund.input.json",
        "output": "contracts/process_refund.output.json"
      },
      "handler": "handlers/bundle.mjs#processRefund",
      "scoped": true,
      "sensitivity": "high",
      "defaultEffect": "deny",
      "defaultRoles": {
        "org": { "Owner": "allow", "Admin": "allow" },
        "workspace": { "Owner": "allow", "Member": "require_approval" }
      },
      "agent": { "requiresApproval": true, "riskLevel": "high", "category": "commerce" },
      "audit": { "targetKind": "acme.return", "targetIdField": "returnId" },
      "render": { "componentId": "capability-result", "titleField": "refundId" },
      "produces": ["acme.refundId"],
      "consumes": ["acme.returnId"],

      "permissions": {                        // §9.4 — everything else is denied
        "capabilities": ["search_graph_nodes", "send_notification"],
        "secrets": ["ACME_OMS_TOKEN"],        // vault key NAMES, never values
        "network": ["oms.acme.com"],
        "ai": { "tiers": ["fast", "balanced"] }
      },
      "limits": { "timeoutMs": 30000, "memoryMb": 512 }
    }
  ],

  "sandbox": { "image": null }                // optional digest-pinned custom runner image (§9.2)
}
```

Field-for-field, a manifest capability entry is the serializable projection of
`CapabilityDeclaration` (`packages/oxagen/src/types.ts:145`) — same `mode`,
`surfaces`, `layers`-implied artifacts, `agent`, `sensitivity`,
`defaultEffect`, `defaultRoles`, `audit`, `render`, `produces`/`consumes` —
plus the three package-only blocks: `handler` (entry point), `permissions`,
and `limits`. **The manifest is the contract**, as the in-repo declaration
is, so the registry overlay (§8) can materialize a
real `CapabilityDeclaration` from it and everything downstream (kernel, IAM
seeding, `capability.registry.*`, materializeTools, binders) treats installed
and first-party capabilities uniformly.

### 5.2 What is *not* in a package

- **No secret values** — only vault key names (`permissions.secrets`),
  matching the sandbox-template manifest rule ("names, never values").
- **No platform code** — bundles must not import `@oxagen/*` packages;
  `@oxagen/cap-sdk` is type-only at runtime (the host API arrives as the
  handler's `ctx` argument). `cap build` fails the build otherwise.
- **No workspace/org identifiers** — packages are portable across workspaces
  and orgs; identity is injected at invocation time via `ctx`.

---

## 6. Authoring experience

### 6.1 Repo scaffold and SDK

```bash
oxagen cap init acme/returns          # scaffolds a Git-ready repo
```

```
returns/
├── cap.config.ts            # package-level metadata (id, namespace, publisher, runtime)
├── capabilities/
│   ├── process_refund.ts    # contract — defineCapability({...})
│   ├── process_refund.handler.ts
│   ├── process_refund.test.ts
│   └── process_refund.md    # doc, verbatim into the package docs/ dir
├── ui/                      # reserved — custom components (future spec, §10.4 stub)
├── package.json             # devDeps: @oxagen/cap-sdk, @oxagen/cap-cli
└── .github/workflows/cap.yml  # scaffolded CI: build → test → publish on tag
```

The contract file mirrors first-party authoring one-for-one so the mental
model transfers (and so our own contracts can migrate later):

```ts
// capabilities/process_refund.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { defineCapability } from "@oxagen/cap-sdk";

export const processRefund = defineCapability({
  action: "process_refund",
  displayName: "Process refund",
  description: "Validate a return, compute the refund, execute it, notify the customer.",
  mode: "sync",
  surfaces: ["api", "mcp", "agent", "app", "cli"],
  sensitivity: "high",
  defaultEffect: "deny",
  defaultRoles: {
    org: { Owner: "allow", Admin: "allow" },
    workspace: { Owner: "allow", Member: "require_approval" },
  },
  agent: { requiresApproval: true, riskLevel: "high", category: "commerce" },
  audit: { targetKind: "acme.return", targetIdField: "returnId" },
  input: z.object({
    returnId: z.string().min(1),
    reason: z.enum(["damaged", "wrong_item", "no_longer_needed", "other"]),
    refundShipping: z.boolean().default(false),
  }),
  output: z.object({
    refundId: z.string(),
    amountCents: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
    currency: z.string().length(3),
    status: z.enum(["executed", "pending_review"]),
  }),
  permissions: {
    capabilities: ["search_graph_nodes", "send_notification"],
    secrets: ["ACME_OMS_TOKEN"],
    network: ["oms.acme.com"],
  },
});
```

```ts
// capabilities/process_refund.handler.ts
import { defineHandler } from "@oxagen/cap-sdk";
import { processRefund } from "./process_refund";

export const processRefundHandler = defineHandler(processRefund, async (input, ctx) => {
  const omsToken = await ctx.secrets.get("ACME_OMS_TOKEN");        // vault, declared key only
  const ret = await fetch(`https://oms.acme.com/returns/${input.returnId}`, {
    headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${omsToken}` },
  }).then((r) => r.json());                                        // egress allow-listed

  const amountCents = computeRefund(ret, input.refundShipping);
  const refund = await executeRefund(omsToken, ret, amountCents);

  await ctx.invoke("send_notification", {                          // kernel re-entry, permissioned
    userId: ret.customerId,
    title: `Refund issued: ${(amountCents / 100).toFixed(2)} ${ret.currency}`,
  });

  return { refundId: refund.id, amountCents, currency: ret.currency, status: "executed" };
});
```

Handlers are typed against the contract like
`CapabilityHandler<typeof svgGenerate>` is today
(`packages/oxagen/src/types.ts:250`) — `(input, ctx) => Promise<output>` with
inference from the Zod schemas. The **difference** from first-party handlers
is the `ctx`: first-party handlers import platform packages directly and rely
on ambient tenant scope; customer handlers get **only** the brokered host API
(§9.3).

### 6.2 The toolchain

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `oxagen cap init` | Scaffold repo (above). |
| `oxagen cap dev` | Local dev loop: runs the handler in the local runner image (docker sandbox driver), serves a local surface emulator (REST + MCP + auto-form UI) against a local host broker with fixture and live-proxy modes (§6.3). |
| `oxagen cap test` | Runs the author's tests inside the runner image + the platform conformance suite: contract portability (§7), manifest validity, handler I/O round-trips against the compiled schemas, permission-violation probes (undeclared capability/secret/host must fail). |
| `oxagen cap build` | Compile contracts (Zod → JSON Schema, §7), bundle handlers/UI (esbuild, externals forbidden), emit manifest + integrity, produce `dist/<id>-<version>.cap`. |
| `oxagen cap publish` | Upload the `.cap` to the org's package registry (§8.1). `--workspace` also installs. CI runs this on tag push. |
| `oxagen cap doctor` | Static lint of an existing repo/package: naming, schema subset, permission hygiene, doc presence. |

**Git is the source of truth.** A published version records
`{ gitRemote?, commitSha?, tag? }` when built via CI or Package Studio (§11.2),
so every installed version is traceable to a commit. The platform never edits
customer capability code; the DB stores install state and immutable artifacts
only.

### 6.3 Local dev, debugging, and errors

Adoption depends on the dev loop, so it is **beta-blocking**
(plan Phase 2):

- **`oxagen cap dev`** runs the bundle in the local runner image (docker
  driver) behind a local surface emulator — REST on localhost, an MCP
  endpoint any client can connect to, the auto-form page — with the host
  broker in one of two modes:
  - **Fixture mode** (default): `ctx.invoke` / `ctx.secrets` / `ctx.ai`
    resolve from declarative fixtures in `fixtures/` (hand-written or
    recorded responses keyed by capability/secret name), so the loop is
    hermetic, fast, and CI-safe — `cap test` runs against the same fixtures.
  - **Live mode** (`--workspace <dev-workspace>`): the broker proxies to a
    real workspace under the author's credentials with normal IAM, billing,
    and audit — the integration-test path before publishing.
- **Error taxonomy** (SDK): `throw new CapUserError(message, details?)` is a
  *caller-facing* failure — the message crosses the boundary verbatim
  (schema-validated, size-clamped) on every surface. Any other throw is an
  *internal* error: callers get a generic failure plus `runId`; the full
  stack and the `ctx.log` stream appear only in the run detail view.
  Timeouts, OOM kills, and permission denials surface as distinct typed
  runner errors, never generic 500s, so an author can tell "my bug" from "my
  limits" from "my manifest".
- **Publisher observability:** every invocation is a `capability_runs` row
  (§9.5) with retained logs; the package detail page rolls up per-version
  error rate, p50/p95 latency, and top error classes across the org's
  installs. Cross-org publisher telemetry is explicitly a Phase 4
  (marketplace) question — in v1 the publisher and installer are the same
  org and see the same runs.

---

## 7. Typed contracts across the trust boundary

Every capability has a typed contract validated by the
kernel on both edges (`cap.input.safeParse` at `kernel.ts:597`,
`cap.output.safeParse` at `kernel.ts:946`). Customer packages must not weaken
this, and the kernel must not execute customer code to validate (a Zod schema
is executable JavaScript; shipping the author's compiled Zod into the platform
process would be arbitrary code execution).

Resolution — **portable schemas, platform-materialized validators**:

1. **Authors write Zod** (v3, the platform's pinned major) in
   `defineCapability`. Full Zod is available to *their handler* at runtime for
   assertions/refinements inside the sandbox.
2. **`cap build` compiles `input`/`output` to JSON Schema** (draft 2020-12)
   via the same `zod-to-json-schema` pipeline the repo already uses
   (`apps/schemas/scripts/generate.ts`,
   `tools/scripts/gen-capability-schemas.ts`), and **fails the build** on any
   construct that does not compile faithfully: `transform`, `preprocess`,
   `refine`/`superRefine`, `lazy`/recursive types, `custom`, functions,
   promises, non-serializable defaults. The allowed subset (objects, arrays,
   records, primitives, enums/literals, unions/discriminated unions,
   optional/nullable/default, string formats, numeric bounds, min/max) covers
   every shape the 349 in-repo contracts use in their I/O — this was the
   design constraint on the subset.
3. **At install time the platform materializes Zod validators from the JSON
   Schemas** (deterministic data → schema conversion; schemas are data, never
   evaluated). The materialized `CapabilityDeclaration` is what the registry
   overlay serves — so the kernel, `materializeTools` (which feeds
   `cap.input` to the AI SDK), the MCP tool list, and the app form generator
   all consume installed contracts through the **same fields** they already
   read on first-party ones. No conditional code paths downstream.
4. **Checksummed compatibility:** the compiled schema is hashed into
   `integrity.json`; the version's schema hash participates in upgrade
   compatibility checks (§11.4).

Per-field descriptions (`.describe()`) survive compilation and become the MCP
tool field descriptions and auto-form labels/help — this replaces the
hand-written `.describe()` overlay files in `apps/mcp/src/tools/`.

## 8. Dynamic registry overlay

### 8.1 Data model (three new tables, `plugin` schema)

Following the `agent.skill_versions` immutability pattern
(`packages/database/src/schema/agent.ts:203`) rather than widening
`installed_plugins` (which has no version concept and is a denormalized
config row):

```
plugin.capability_packages          -- publisher registry (org-scoped)
  id, public_id, org_id, package_id ("acme/returns"), namespace (UNIQUE globally),
  display_name, source_repo, created_by, timestamps, soft-delete

plugin.capability_package_versions  -- immutable artifacts
  id, public_id, package_id → capability_packages,
  version (semver; UNIQUE per package), manifest jsonb (snapshot),
  storage_key (private blob: the .cap bytes), package_digest (sha256),
  schema_digest, git_remote, git_commit, git_tag,
  status ('validated' | 'revoked'), is_latest, created_by, created_at
  -- rows are never mutated after validation; revocation is a status flip

plugin.capability_installs          -- per-workspace activation
  id, public_id, org_id, workspace_id, package_id,
  active_version_id → capability_package_versions,
  enabled (default false), installed_from ('upload' | 'git' | 'studio'),
  installed_by, timestamps, soft-delete
  UNIQUE (workspace_id, package_id)
```

The `.cap` blob goes to private storage via the existing `StorageAdapter`
(`packages/storage/src/types.ts:75`, `access: "private"`), with a new asset
kind `capability_package` and a 50 MiB limit added to
`packages/storage/src/assets.ts` (current max is `document` 25 MiB; UI bundles
justify the headroom).

### 8.2 Kernel resolution

The kernel today resolves declarations from the static registry
(`getCapability`, `registry.ts:80`) and handlers from the handler map
(`resolveHandler`, `kernel.ts:466`). Both gain an **injected workspace-scoped
fallback**, using the established kernel-injection pattern
(`setKernelIAMRuntime`, `setCapabilityEntitlementGate` at `kernel.ts:83`):

```
setDynamicCapabilityResolver(async (name, { orgId, workspaceId }) => {
  // 1. static registry hit? → not called (static always wins)
  // 2. cache lookup: workspace → { name → MaterializedCapability }
  //    (TTL 30s + event invalidation on install/enable/version-activate,
  //     mirroring entitlement-service.ts caching)
  // 3. MaterializedCapability = { declaration, dispatch }
  //    declaration: CapabilityDeclaration w/ materialized Zod (§7)
  //    dispatch:    the runner client (§9), closed over package/version refs
})
```

Resolution order in `_invokeCore`: static → dynamic → `unknown_capability`.
Namespace rules (§4) guarantee the two sets are disjoint, so resolution
order is not a security control. Everything after resolution — surface
allowlist, input parse, IAM, billing, entitlement, output parse, audit,
tracing — runs **unchanged** on the materialized declaration. The entitlement
service (`packages/plugins/src/entitlements/entitlement-service.ts`) extends
its union to include `capability_installs` (enabled, non-deleted, active
version validated), keeping the fail-closed behavior `materialize-tools`
already relies on.

Enumeration (`capabilitiesForSurface`, `kernel.ts:1172`) gains a
workspace-aware variant `capabilitiesForSurfaceInWorkspace(surface, scope)` =
static ∪ installed — this is the single API every surface binder (§10)
consumes, so a new surface binder automatically covers installed capabilities
and vice versa.

`capability.registry.list` / `capability.registry.get` read through the same
overlay, so the governance catalog, docs pages, and `agent.tool.list` show
installed capabilities with an `origin: "package"` marker and their package
provenance — the same "catalog can never drift from the enforced shape"
property those handlers guarantee today.

---

## 9. Execution: the capability runner

Customer code **never executes in a platform process.** ADR-013 Phase 3's
unbuilt "out-of-process handler protocol" lands here, on the shipped sandbox
substrate.

### 9.1 Placement

- **Default: sandboxed runner.** Bundles execute inside the sandbox drivers
  (`packages/sandbox/src/index.ts` — Modal/Vercel Firecracker in
  preview/prod, Docker in dev/self-host), always through the policy
  chokepoint (`getSandbox` → `withPolicy`) that clamps CPU/memory/timeout and
  enforces the network policy.
- **`trusted` profile (first-party only).** The same package format executed
  in-process, handler resolved from the bundle at boot — this is how
  first-party capabilities can migrate onto the package model (§13) with zero
  latency cost. Gated to `source: "oxagen"` packages; never available to
  customer packages regardless of plan.

### 9.2 Runner sessions

A cold Firecracker boot per invocation would put seconds on the p50, so the
runner uses **warm durable sessions** — the mechanism `agent.sandbox.start`
already ships (create/exec/snapshot/stop, idle reaping via the sandbox
reaper):

- Per **(workspace, package version)** warm session pool, size 0→N with idle
  TTL; the session runs the **runner supervisor** from the digest-pinned
  platform runner image (`oxagen/cap-runner@sha256:…`, Node 20, no package
  manager, read-only bundle mount). A package may pin a custom image
  (`manifest.sandbox.image`, digest-required) for native deps; custom images
  are a plan-gated feature and scanned at publish.
- An invocation = one `execInSession` of `cap-call <action>`, which hands the
  JSON envelope `{ invocationId, input, ctxSlice, hostToken }` to the
  supervisor over a local socket and returns `{ output } | { error }` on
  stdout. Driver-portable (uses nothing beyond exec), stateless per call,
  and warm (supervisor holds the loaded bundle).
- `limits.timeoutMs` (manifest, clamped by policy ceiling) bounds the exec;
  the kernel's own invocation timeout is the outer layer, following the
  nested-timeout discipline documented in the video pipeline
  (`packages/inngest-functions/src/functions/agent.video-render.ts:27`).

### 9.3 The host API (the ports of a capability)

The handler's `ctx` is a **brokered client, not platform handles**. Transport:
HTTPS callback to `POST /v1/runner/host` carrying a **per-invocation scoped
token** — short-lived (invocation TTL), bound to
`{ invocationId, orgId, workspaceId, principal, packageVersionId, permissions }`,
signed by the platform, single-audience. The sandbox network policy always
allows the platform API host; everything else requires
`permissions.network`.

| `ctx` member | Backed by | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| `ctx.invoke(name, input)` | `kernel.invoke()` re-entry with the invocation's principal, `surface: "runner"` (already in the `CapabilityContext.surface` union, `types.ts:271`) | `permissions.capabilities` allow-list checked by the broker **and** normal kernel IAM/billing/entitlement on the inner call — deny wins at either layer. Re-entry depth capped (default 4); recursion into the calling capability denied. |
| `ctx.secrets.get(name)` | Vault (`secret_keys`/`secret_values`, envelope-encrypted via `@oxagen/crypto`), resolved for the workspace's environment | `permissions.secrets` names only; every read hits `secret_access_log`; values never appear in traces/logs. |
| `ctx.ai.generateObject/text(...)` | `@oxagen/ai` gateway paths (`generateObjectFor` etc.) | `permissions.ai.tiers`; metered through the existing token pipeline under the org (§9.6). |
| `ctx.storage.put/get(...)` + `ctx.assets.persist(...)` | `StorageAdapter` + the `persistGeneratedAsset` seam (what `svg.generate` uses) | Keys server-derived under the workspace prefix; private access; size limits. |
| `ctx.runs` (async mode, §9.5) | `capability_runs` progress updates | Own run only. |
| `ctx.log(level, msg, fields)` | Invocation log stream, retained per run | Size/rate clamped; surfaced in the app's run detail view. |
| `ctx` identity fields | `orgId`, `workspaceId`, `userId`, `principal`, `requestId`, `messageId`, `surface` — the same fields first-party handlers read from `CheckedContext` | Read-only slice; no `planTier` mutation, no raw principal token. |

`sdk.capSdk` in the manifest pins the host-API contract version; the broker
serves every published major so installed packages keep working across
platform deploys.

### 9.4 Permissions model

`permissions` is **default-deny and closed**: an empty block means the handler
can compute on its input and return — no capability calls, no secrets, no
egress, no AI. Install-time consent (§11.3) renders the block as the
human-readable grant screen (comparable to an OAuth scopes screen). Enforcement is
layered: sandbox network policy (egress), broker allow-lists (capabilities,
secrets, AI tiers), kernel IAM (the inner call), vault audit (reads). A
permission the manifest did not declare cannot be granted at install time —
widening requires publishing a new version, so the grant screen lists
everything the installed version can do.

### 9.5 Sync and async modes

- **`mode: "sync"`** — request/response through the warm session;
  `limits.timeoutMs ≤ 60s`. This is Acme's refund call.
- **`mode: "async"`** — the platform (not the author) provides the job
  envelope, generalizing the `video.generate` pattern (pending row → Inngest
  event → worker → status flip) that today is hand-built per capability:
  1. `invoke()` validates input, writes a `capability_runs` row
     (`pending`), emits `cap/execute` to Inngest, and returns the uniform
     envelope `{ status: "queued", runId, statusUrl }` immediately.
  2. The Inngest function (`capability.execute`, org-keyed concurrency,
     policy-derived `timeouts.finish`, `retries: 0` default with manifest
     opt-in) re-establishes tenant scope, dispatches to the runner session,
     streams `ctx.runs.progress()` updates onto the row, and lands
     `succeeded` (output validated against the contract) or `failed`.
  3. Reads are uniform: new first-party contract `read_capability_run`
     surfaces run status on **every** surface (REST poll, MCP tool, app run
     view, CLI `--wait`), replacing per-capability polling conventions.
  `capability_runs`: `id, public_id, org_id, workspace_id, capability_name,
  package_version_id?, status (pending|running|succeeded|failed|cancelled),
  input jsonb, output jsonb, error, progress jsonb, timings, cost_usd_micros,
  created_by, message_id?`. First-party async capabilities (video) migrate
  onto this envelope in §13.

### 9.6 Metering and billing

Two-gate discipline, extended (per `packages/billing`):

- **Admission:** unchanged — customer capabilities are subject to the kernel
  billing gate (`assertOrgCanConsume`) unless the manifest sets
  `noBillingGate` *and* the package passes review for it (default: gate on).
- **Usage:** (a) every `ctx.ai` call flows through the existing
  `insertTokenUsage`/credit pipeline — brokered calls are indistinguishable
  from first-party usage; (b) **runner compute** is metered per invocation
  (wall-ms × memory class) with new rate-card entries in
  `packages/billing/src/pricing.ts` following the bias-high rule ("unknown
  cost must never be silently free"); (c) whether to charge a per-invocation
  platform fee is a pricing decision; the meter hook exists either way. Cost lands on `capability_runs.cost_usd_micros` and the standard
  usage breakdowns (`billing.usage.breakdown` already slices by capability
  name; usage attribution already keys on capability slices).

---

## 10. The surface parity engine

Binder principle: every surface derives its bindings from
`capabilitiesForSurfaceInWorkspace(surface, scope)` and the declaration
fields — the way `materializeTools` already does. **Surface parity follows
from how bindings are built**; the existing
parity gates stay on as regression alarms and are re-pointed at the binders
(they assert the binder covers the registry, not that N files exist).

### 10.1 REST (`apps/api`)

- **Generic dispatch route** (new):
  `POST /v1/:org/:workspace/cap/:name` → resolve → `invoke(name, body, ctx,
  { surface: "api" })`. This single route serves **every** installed
  capability the moment it is enabled — no mount step, no deploy.
- **One path shape.** Installed capabilities are served only
  at the uniform dispatch route — no per-capability "pretty path" aliases.
  (Considered and deferred: aliases would add per-workspace collision
  rules, install-cache invalidation, and OpenAPI complexity for cosmetic
  value; revisit only with customer evidence.) First-party capabilities
  keep their existing paths via a **route table** (name → path/method) that
  replaces the 276 wrapper files and the hand-listed `app.ts` imports with
  one loop at boot — same middleware chain
  (`authMiddleware`/`orgMiddleware`/`workspaceMiddleware`), same
  `capabilityContext(c)`, same error middleware, byte-identical responses
  (§13 gates on this).
- **Async envelope:** `mode: "async"` returns `202 { status: "queued", runId,
  statusUrl }`; `GET .../cap/runs/:runId` is the `read_capability_run`
  binding. (Existing `video.generate` keeps its 200 envelope until its §13
  migration, then 202 under an API version flag.)
- **OpenAPI:** a workspace-scoped generated document
  (`GET /v1/:org/:workspace/openapi.json`) emitted from the same compiled
  JSON Schemas — installed capabilities appear in the customer's own API
  reference automatically. (New capability `export_openapi_document`;
  Phase 3.)

### 10.2 MCP (`apps/mcp`)

This is the surface Acme's non-Oxagen agent runner connects to, so it must be
**per-workspace dynamic** — which file-based discovery cannot do:

- xmcp 0.6.10 enumerates tools by scanning `src/tools/` at build time
  (`apps/mcp/xmcp.config.ts`); the tool set is baked per deploy and identical
  for every caller. The MCP protocol itself supports per-connection
  `tools/list` and `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
- **Change:** the MCP app moves to a **programmatic tool provider**:
  `tools/list` = static registry (surface `mcp`) ∪ the authenticated
  workspace's installs, built from declarations (name, description, compiled
  input schema with field descriptions); `tools/call` = `buildContext` →
  `invoke(name, args, ctx, { surface: "mcp" })` → output-validated result.
  Install/enable/disable emits `list_changed`. The 330 static tool files are
  deleted in §13; their per-field `.describe()` overlays move into the
  contracts (where they survive schema compilation, §7).
  If xmcp cannot host a dynamic provider cleanly, the server drops to the
  official MCP SDK behind the same auth middleware — the auth model
  (`buildContext`, API-key → org/workspace scope) is unchanged either way.
- Agent-facing annotations derive from declarations: `sensitivity`/`agent`
  metadata → `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`, `requiresApproval` surfaces as
  the existing consent flow.

### 10.3 Agent tools (`packages/agent`)

Cheapest surface: `materializeTools` already filters by entitlement
fail-closed (`materialize-tools.ts:335`). It switches its enumeration to the
workspace-aware overlay API and installed capabilities become agent tools
with approval gating, risk badges, telemetry, and model-name aliasing — zero
new mechanism. `agent.compose` chaining picks up `produces`/`consumes` tags
from manifests for free.

### 10.4 App (`apps/app`)

Three layers, all riding existing render plumbing:

1. **Generic capability runner page** (new):
   `/w/:workspace/capabilities/:name` renders an **auto-form** from the
   compiled input schema (field types/labels/help from the schema + 
   `.describe()` texts; enum → select, boolean → toggle, nested objects →
   groups), submits through a generic server action →
   `invoke(name, input, ctx, { surface: "app" })`, and renders the result
   through the existing precedence — output-embedded `render` directive →
   contract render hint → generic `capability-result` card
   (`resolveRenderDirective` in `packages/oxagen/src/capability-meta.ts`,
   components in `chat-component-registry.tsx`). Async mode renders the run
   view driven by `read_capability_run`. This page also gives **first-party**
   `app`-layer capabilities a default UI, replacing hand-built
   action+form+ui-map wiring for the standard case;
   `capability-ui-map.json` entries are auto-emitted for installed
   capabilities so `check:ui-parity` stays truthful.
2. **Curated components:** the manifest may reference any registered
   componentId (`svg-preview`, `image-preview`, `video-result`,
   `file-attachment`, `capability-result`, …) via `render.componentId` —
   customers whose outputs fit standard shapes get rich rendering with zero
   UI code.
3. **Custom components — STUB; deferred to a dedicated spec.** Custom UI
   exists for user-experience reasons only: some customer capabilities need
   a **human in the loop** where a schema form does not fit — an airline's
   `assign_seat` capability needs a seating-chart picker rather than
   fourteen text inputs. The need is **app-surface-only** (REST/MCP/agent/CLI
   parity is unaffected by its absence), and it is **not v1**. v1 reserves
   the space for it: the `ui/` package directory and the manifest `ui` block
   are **reserved** — validation warns and ignores them, and rendering
   falls back to layers 1–2 (auto-form + curated components), so a package
   shipping UI early degrades gracefully instead of breaking. The future
   spec (`docs/specs/customer-capabilities-ui/`) owns the hard parts —
   embedding isolation (the platform's stored-SVG XSS discipline is the
   minimum), a typed props/actions bridge, publisher trust
   tiers — and must clear a dedicated security review before any customer
   component renders.

Discovery (all layers): installed capabilities appear in the workspace
capability catalog, the sidebar's Installed section, and the command menu
(indexed by `command.menu.search` alongside first-party rows).

### 10.5 CLI (`apps/cli`) — and how "a CLI custom to a workspace" works

Acme's operators need a refund command that exists **only** in workspaces
where the package is installed. Three options:

| Option | How | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Dynamic materialization in the standard CLI** | CLI syncs the workspace capability index; commands are generated at parse time from declarations | **Recommended — v1** |
| B. npm-distributed CLI plugin packages (oclif-style) | `.cap` also emits an npm plugin; users install per machine | Deferred: supply-chain surface, per-machine drift, duplicate artifact; revisit for offline-heavy fleets |
| C. Per-workspace compiled binaries | CI builds a branded binary per workspace | Rejected: distribution/signing/update churn; no capability the dynamic approach lacks |

**Option A mechanics.** The CLI already resolves org/workspace from config
and calls REST (`apps/cli/src/lib/api.ts`); it gains:

- `oxagen sync` — fetch the workspace capability index (name, display, http
  path, cli hints, compiled input schema, mode) → cache at
  `.oxagen/capabilities.json` (TTL + `--refresh`; also refreshed on auth and
  workspace switch). Everything below works offline-after-sync; invocation
  requires network anyway.
- **One form:** `oxagen cap run <name> [--json | flags]` —
  flags derived from the schema (kebab-cased fields, enums validated,
  booleans as toggles, nested via dotted flags), output pretty-printed or
  `--json`; async mode prints the runId and polls `read_capability_run`
  unless `--no-wait`. Acme's command is:
  `oxagen cap run acme_returns_process_refund --return-id R-1042 --reason damaged`.
  Manifest-declared first-class command groups (`oxagen returns refund …`)
  are **considered and deferred** for the same reason as HTTP pretty paths
  (§10.1): they add reserved-name and collision machinery for ergonomics
  that completions already deliver — and a user who wants brevity has shell
  aliases. Revisit with customer evidence.
- **Completions & help:** shell completions for `cap run` — capability
  names and their flags — regenerate from the cache on sync, so
  discoverability matches hand-written commands. The REPL slash catalog
  derives from the same commander tree, so installed capabilities appear
  there too — the existing `slash-parity` tests extend to cover the dynamic
  set.

This keeps **one** distributed binary (`@oxagen/cli` on npm), no per-workspace
builds, and the workspace-specific behavior lives where the rest of this
design puts it: in the synced, signed capability index. The only per-workspace
artifact is a cache file.

### 10.6 Docs surface

The `docs` layer stays mandatory: `docs/<action>.md` ships in the package,
renders on the capability's catalog page (with contract tables generated from
the compiled schemas, the way `capability.registry.get` derives field specs
today), and is exported by `system.install.instructions`-style copy blocks
(REST curl, MCP config for external runners, CLI invocation) generated from
the same declaration. Nothing is hand-synced.

---

## 11. Install & lifecycle

### 11.1 Validation pipeline (every path funnels through it)

On upload/build: unzip in an isolated worker → `integrity.json` digest check →
manifest schema parse (`capabilityPackageManifestSchema`) → namespace
ownership check → naming rules (§4) → schema portability re-verification (the
platform re-compiles and compares digests; the client's compiler is not
trusted) → bundle static checks (no `@oxagen/*` imports, no `node:` besides
the allowed set, size caps) → docs presence per capability → reserved
`ui/` / manifest-`ui` warning (§10.4 stub — warned and ignored, never
processed) → optional publisher policy checks (org-configurable: require review,
forbid `network`, cap sensitivity). Result: a `capability_package_versions`
row (`status: "validated"`) with the blob in private storage. Failures return
a structured report (the same report `cap doctor` prints locally).

### 11.2 Ways in (the "Compile/Package" processes)

1. **Local:** `oxagen cap build` + `oxagen cap publish` (CI-friendly; the
   scaffolded GitHub Action publishes on tag).
2. **Package Studio (in-app):** connect a repo (the GitHub app connection
   from ADR-027 / `repo.*` capabilities) → pick ref/tag → the platform runs
   `cap build` **inside a build sandbox** (Docker/Firecracker driver, network
   restricted to the repo host + registry mirror, resource-clamped) as an
   Inngest job → validation pipeline → version appears in the org registry
   with full Git provenance. Build logs stream to the Studio via the run
   view. This is the "process in the existing app to compile/package" — same
   validation funnel as local, so Studio and local builds are trusted
   equally.
3. **Direct `.cap` upload** (app or `POST /v1/:org/:workspace/cap-packages`):
   for air-gapped or vendor-delivered packages; identical funnel.

### 11.3 Install, consent, enable

`install_capability_package { packageId, versionId?, workspaceId }` (Owner or
Admin; new first-party contracts — `install_capability_package`,
`uninstall_capability_package`, `activate_capability_package_version`,
`set_capability_package_enabled`, `list_capability_packages`,
`read_capability_package`) creates/updates the `capability_installs` row
**disabled by default** (the `plugin.org.install` precedent), shows the
consent screen rendered from the manifest — capabilities being added (with
sensitivity badges), permission grants, secret names required (with a
one-click path to create missing vault keys), egress hosts — and requires
explicit enable. Enabling seeds the declared `defaultRoles` grants through
the standard IAM seeding path and invalidates the resolver/entitlement
caches; the capability is live on every declared surface within the cache
TTL, no deploy.

### 11.4 Upgrade, rollback, uninstall, revoke

- **Upgrade** = activate a different immutable version
  (`skill.version.activate` semantics). The diff screen shows semver bump,
  CHANGELOG, contract schema diff (from schema digests), and **permission
  delta — any widening re-triggers consent**. Majors with breaking contract
  changes are flagged from the schema diff (removed/retyped fields,
  narrowed enums).
- **Rollback** = activate any prior validated version (immutability makes
  this trivial and fast).
- **Uninstall** soft-deletes the install; runs history is retained;
  role grants referencing the names become inert (text ids, nothing
  dangles).
- **Revoke** (publisher or platform trust action) flips a version's status;
  installs pinned to it are force-disabled with notification — the kill
  switch for a bad or malicious version. A platform-level
  `CAP_PACKAGES_ENABLED` env kill switch (registered in
  `packages/config/src/registry.ts` per house rule) disables all dynamic
  resolution instantly.

### 11.5 Upgrade blast radius on callers

Activating a version changes the contract *for everyone already calling
it*; the installer's diff screen (§11.4) does not by itself protect existing
callers:

- **Agent conversations** re-materialize tools each turn, so a running
  conversation picks up the new schema on its next step; a tool call
  already in flight completes against the version that dispatched it.
- **MCP clients** receive `notifications/tools/list_changed` (§10.2); a
  client that ignores it and sends stale arguments gets a structured
  `invalid_input` whose payload embeds the current compiled input schema —
  self-healing for schema-reading clients, diagnosable for everything else.
- **REST callers and automations are enumerable before the fact:**
  ClickHouse `tool_invocations` slices by capability name, so the
  activation screen shows a **consumer preview** — the surfaces, API keys,
  and automation triggers that invoked this capability in the last 30
  days — and flags contract-breaking majors against that live list. After
  activation, the first failed run per consumer raises a notification
  instead of failing silently inside a scheduler.
- **Compatibility rule enforced by validation:** a minor version must be
  accept-compatible (new optional input fields, additive output fields);
  anything that removes, retypes, or narrows is a major and turns the
  consumer preview into a blocking warning. Per-consumer version pinning
  (blue/green) is deliberately out of scope — one active version per
  workspace keeps the registry, IAM, and audit story simple.

---

## 12. Security model

Threats and their boundaries (defense-in-depth, each layer independently
fail-closed):

1. **Hostile handler code** → never in-process (§9.1); Firecracker/Docker
   isolation; policy-clamped CPU/memory/time; read-only bundle; no ambient
   credentials in the session (vault values are fetched per-call through the
   broker, not injected into env, unlike agent sandboxes' `setupEnv`, because
   this code runs unattended).
2. **Data exfiltration** → default-deny egress; `permissions.network`
   allow-list enforced by the sandbox network policy; the only always-open
   host is the platform broker endpoint.
3. **Privilege escalation via the platform** → every effect re-enters
   `kernel.invoke()` under the *invocation's* principal with the manifest
   allow-list intersected — a customer capability can never do more than
   (caller's IAM) ∩ (declared permissions) ∩ (workspace install consent).
   Approval-requiring capabilities still require approval when called from a
   runner. Invocation tokens are short-lived, single-invocation, audience-
   bound.
4. **Contract poisoning** → schemas are data (§7); the platform re-compiles
   and digest-compares at validation; Zod materialization never evaluates
   package code.
5. **UI XSS** → v1 renders installed capabilities exclusively through
   platform-registered components (auto-form + the curated set); customer
   UI bundles are inert (§10.4 stub). The future custom-UI spec must meet
   or exceed: sandboxed embedding, isolated origin, strict CSP, typed
   bridge. Stored-markup rules from the SVG pipeline apply unchanged.
6. **Supply chain** → immutable versions keyed by sha256 digests
   (`integrity.json` + `package_digest`); Git provenance recorded; runner
   images digest-pinned; Studio builds run network-restricted; revocation +
   kill switch (§11.4); this replaces the `skills-lock.json` pattern:
   hashes live in the platform registry, not a repo lockfile.
7. **Tenancy** → runner dispatch carries explicit `{orgId, workspaceId}`;
   all broker reads/writes run inside `runInTenantScope` + RLS
   (`withTenantDb`) as first-party handlers do; packages are
   workspace-installed, org-owned, and never cross-tenant.
8. **Abuse/runaway** → per-org runner concurrency (Inngest org-keyed
   limits, the `agent.video-render` precedent), invocation rate limits at
   the API middleware, compute metering with bias-high pricing, run history
   auditability (`capability_runs` + ClickHouse invocation rows).

---

## 13. Migration & dogfooding: svg / image / video first

The media-generation capabilities migrate first (they are already
"capability packs" in name — `oxagen/media-svg`, `oxagen/media-image`,
`oxagen/media-video` seeded per workspace by
`packages/handlers/src/workspace-capability-seed.ts` — but their manifests only
describe compile-time contracts and nothing is packaged). They become packages
in two steps:

**Step 1 — bind through the generic binders (no package format needed):**
mount `generate_svg`/`generate_image`/`generate_video` REST routes from the
route table (delete their three route files + six `app.ts` lines), serve
their MCP tools from the dynamic provider (delete three tool files), and
render `generate_svg`/`generate_image` through the generic runner page.
Gates: `route-contract-parity` and `tool-registry` tests re-pointed at the
binders; **byte-identical HTTP responses** asserted against recorded
fixtures; existing chat e2e unchanged. Then sweep the remaining ~273 route
files / ~327 tool files in mechanical batches under the same gates.

**Step 2 — re-express as `.cap` packages (trusted profile):** build
`oxagen/media-*` with `cap build` in-repo, install via the standard pipeline,
execute via the `trusted` profile (in-process, §9.1) so latency is unchanged.
This makes first-party packages the permanent conformance fixtures for the
customer pipeline — every release of the platform builds, validates,
installs, and invokes real packages in CI. `generate_video` additionally
migrates its bespoke pending-row flow onto the `capability_runs` envelope
(§9.5), becoming the reference async capability.

Only after both steps does the customer beta open (plan.md sequences this
with gates).

## 14. Open questions

1. **Runner driver and pool keying for v1 GA** — Modal durable sessions
   (shipped) vs Vercel sandbox sessions is the smaller decision; the
   larger one is **pool granularity**. Per
   (workspace × package version) pools give hard publisher isolation but
   idle N sandboxes for N installed packages; one per-workspace session
   hosting multiple bundles cuts the bill but puts different publishers'
   code in one process — cross-package secret exposure within a tenant.
   The Phase 2 spike must price both and pick a default (a plausible
   landing: per-workspace pooling for same-publisher packages only,
   per-package otherwise).
2. **`require_approval` UX for external MCP callers** — an external agent
   runner hitting a pending-approval response gets the JIT access-request id
   today; is polling acceptable for v1 or do we need MCP elicitation
   support?
3. **Custom-image publish scanning** — which scanner (Trivy vs driver-native)
   and which severity threshold blocks publish.
4. **Marketplace lane** — when packages go cross-org (Phase 4), does listing
   ride `workspace-scoped-marketplace`'s `installed_plugins` UX with a new
   plugin type card, or a dedicated packages catalog? (Both registries stay;
   the question is presentation.)
5. **Per-seat vs usage pricing for runner compute** — pricing owns this; the
   meters land either way (§9.6).
6. **CLI offline invocation** — is offline-after-sync enough, or do
   air-gapped fleets justify Option B (npm plugin emission) sooner?
7. **Org-level install** — Acme's refunds package is an org
   capability; installing workspace-by-workspace is toil at 40 workspaces.
   `plugin.org.install_bulk` is precedent for the mechanic; the open design
   questions are defaulting (auto-install into newly created workspaces?)
   and whether org-level consent can bind workspace-level grants without
   eroding the workspace as the IAM boundary.

## 15. Out of scope (tracked elsewhere)

- Community/marketplace publishing and monetization — extends
  `workspace-scoped-marketplace` + `skills-marketplace` once v1 is stable.
- Non-Node runtimes; runner GPU classes.
- Mobile bindings for installed capabilities (ADR-026 parity extension).
- Agent-authored capability packages ("the agent writes and publishes a
  capability") — deliberately later; the human consent surface comes first.
